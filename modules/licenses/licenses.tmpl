This LICENSES file is generated by the `licenses` module in makefile-modules.

The licenses below the "---" are determined by the go-licenses tool.

The aim of this file is to collect the licenses of all dependencies, and provide
a single source of truth for licenses used by this project.

If CI reports that this file is out of date, you should be careful to check that the
new licenses are acceptable for this project before running `make generate-go-licenses`
to update this file.

Acceptable licenses are those allowlisted by the CNCF[0].

You MUST NOT add any new dependencies whose licenses are not allowlisted by the CNCF,
or which do not have an explicit license exception[1].
